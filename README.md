# Plugin Refresher

A tiny plugin manager, allows you to activate and deactivate your plugins quickly for fast iteration.

## Features

### 1.0

- Select your plugin and click the Toggle Button to activate or deactivate it.

### 1.1

Courtesy of @coderbloke, now the toolbar can extend to how several new ways of changing your plugins:
- A set of checkboxes
- A selector for your plugin + a toggle button AND a refresh button.

### Issues / Roadmap

- [ ] Won't load the toolbar when plugin just installs, currently requiring installing another plugin or project reload.
- [ ] Refreshing a plugin won't keep the selected main screen open, since the plugin ceases to exist for a moment.
- [ ] Integration with the future upcoming addon manager that @mrpedrobraga has in mind.
